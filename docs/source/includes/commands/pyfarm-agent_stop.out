usage: pyfarm-agent [status|start|stop] stop [-h] [--no-wait]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

optional flags:
  Flags that control how the agent is stopped

  --no-wait   If provided then don't wait on the agent to shut itself down. By
              default we would want to wait on each task to stop so we can
              catch any errors and then finally wait on the agent to shutdown
              too. If you're in a hurry or stopping a bunch of agents at once
              then setting this flag will let the agent continue to stop
              itself without waiting for each agent
