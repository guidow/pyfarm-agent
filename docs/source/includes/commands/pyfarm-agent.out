Agent Network Service:

  --port PORT           The port number which the agent is either running on
                        or will run on when started. This port is also
                        reported the master when an agent starts. [default:
                        50000]
  --host HOST           The host to communicate with or hostname to present to
                        the master when starting. Defaults to
                        'motoko.pyfarm.io' for the start command and
                        'localhost' other targets such as status or stop.
  --agent-api-username AGENT_API_USERNAME
                        The username required to access or manipulate the
                        agent using REST. [default: agent]

  --systemid SYSTEMID   The system identification value. This is used to help
                        identify the system itself to the master when the
                        agent connects.
  --systemid-cache SYSTEMID_CACHE

Network Resources:
  Resources which the agent will be communicating with.

  --master MASTER       This is a convenience flag which will allow you to set
                        the hostname for the master. By default this value
                        will be substituted in --master-api
  --master-api MASTER_API
                        The location where the master's REST api is located.
                        [default: http://%(master)s/api/v1]

Process Control:
  These settings apply to the parent process of the agent and contribute to
  allowing the process to run as other users or remain isolated in an
  environment. They also assist in maintaining the 'running state' via a
  process id file.

  --pidfile PIDFILE     The file to store the process id in. [default:
                        /tmp/pyfarm/agent/agent.pid]
  -n, --no-daemon       If provided then do not run the process in the
                        background.
  --chroot CHROOT       The directory to chroot the agent do upon launch. This
                        is an optional security measure and generally is not
  --uid UID             The user id to run the agent as. *This setting is
                        ignored on Windows.*
  --gid GID             The group id to run the agent as. *This setting is
                        ignored on Windows.*

process.
