Agent Network Service:

  --port PORT           The port number which the agent is either running on
                        or will run on when started. This port is also
                        reported the master when an agent starts. [default:

  --host HOST           The host to communicate with or hostname to present to
                        the master when starting. Defaults to the fully
                        qualified hostname.
  --agent-api-username AGENT_API_USERNAME
                        The username required to access or manipulate the
                        agent using REST. [default: agent]
  --agent-api-password AGENT_API_PASSWORD
                        The password required to access manipulate the agent
                        using REST. [default: agent]
  --agent-id AGENT_ID   The UUID used to identify this agent to the master. By
                        default the agent will attempt to load a cached value
                        however a specific UUID could be provided with this
                        flag.
  --agent-id-file AGENT_ID_FILE
                        The location to store the agent's id. By default the
                        path is platform specific and defined by the
                        `agent_id_file_platform_defaults` key in the
                        configuration. [default: /etc/pyfarm/agent/uuid.dat]

Network Resources:
  Resources which the agent will be communicating with.

  --master MASTER       This is a convenience flag which will allow you to set
                        the hostname for the master. By default this value
                        will be substituted in --master-api

                        shoulduse [default: None]

Process Control:
  These settings apply to the parent process of the agent and contribute to
  allowing the process to run as other users or remain isolated in an
  environment. They also assist in maintaining the 'running state' via a
  process id file.

  --pidfile PIDFILE     The file to store the process id in. [default: None]
  -n, --no-daemon       If provided then do not run the process in the
                        background.
  --chdir CHDIR         The working directory to change the agent into upon
                        launch
  --uid UID             The user id to run the agent as. *This setting is
                        ignored on Windows.*
  --gid GID             The group id to run the agent as. *This setting is
                        ignored on Windows.*
  --pdb-on-unhandled    When set pdb.set_trace() will be called if an
                        unhandled error is caught in the logger

pyfarm-agent is a command line client for working with a local agent. You can
use it to stop, start, and report the general status of a running agent
process.
