# This section configures the agent's logger.
logging:
  # The format of date strings output by the logger
  datefmt: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

  # Defines the cutoff level for different loggers.  By default
  # the only defined cutoff is for root ("").  Logger names
  # should be defined using *'s to define matches:
  #  levels:
  #    - ["", debug]
  #    - ["pf.*", debug]
  #    - ["pf.agent.*", info]
  #    - ["pf.agent.foo", warning]
  # So for the example above, a logger matching:
  #   * pf.* will be set to debug
  #   * pf.agent.* will be set to info
  #   * pf.agent.foo will be explicitly set to warning
  levels:
    - ["", debug]
