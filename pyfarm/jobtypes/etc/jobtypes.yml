# If True then include os.environ in any
# processes launched by job type.
jobtype_include_os_environ: True

# Any additional key/value pairs to include
# in the environment of a process launched
# by a job type.
jobtype_default_environment: {}

# The default location where a job type should
# store cached source code from the master.  Note
# that $temp will be expanded to the local system's
# temp directory.  If this directory does not exist
# it will be created.  Leaving this value blank will
# disable job type caching.
jobtype_cache_directory: $temp/pyfarm/jobtypes/cache

# If True then expand environment variables in file paths.
jobtype_expandvars: True

# If True, then ignore any errors produced when tring
# to map users and groups to IDs.  This will cause the
# underlying methods in the job type to instead run
# as the job type's owner instead, ignoring what the
# incoming job requests.
# NOTE: This value is not used on Windows.
jobtype_ignore_id_mapping_errors: False

# While a job type is running and generating log output
# the file object should flush to disk after this many lines
jobtype_log_flush_after_lines: 50

# In the logging thread block for this many seconds to wait
# for an item to appear in the logging queue.
jobtype_log_queue_timeout: .25

# Configures the thread pool used by job types
# for logging.
jobtype_logging_threadpool:
  # Setting this value to something smaller than `1` will result
  # in an exception being raised.  This value also cannot be larger
  # than `max_threads` below.
  min_threads: 3

  # This value must be greater than or equal to `min_threads`
  # above.  You may also set this value to 'auto' meaning the
  # number of processors times 1.5 or 20 (whichever is lower).
  max_threads: auto

  # As log messages are sent from processes they are stored
  # in an in memory queue.  When the number of messages is higher
  # than this number a thread will be spawned to consume the
  # data and flush it into a file object.
  max_queue_size: 10

  # Most often the operating system will control how often data
  # is written to disk from a file object.  This value overrides
  # that behavior and forces the file object to flush to disk
  # after this many messages have been processed.
  flush_lines: 100
